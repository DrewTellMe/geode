# Geode

Geode is an implementation of the classic 5-stage pipeline as described in Hennessy and Patterson's Computer Organization and Design (Risc-V Edition). It targets the RV64I ISA (and hopefully more in the future).

Geode is written in Atlas/Python. [Atlas](https://github.com/medav/atlas) is a Python-embedded-HDL similar to Chisel/Scala. Note that at the time of this project's creation, Atlas is still in the very early stages of development.
